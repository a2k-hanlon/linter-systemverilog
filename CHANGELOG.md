# v1.2.1
2021-03-17

Fixed https://github.com/a2k-hanlon/linter-veriloghdl/issues/3. Slang versions 0.6+ output error messages to the  `stderr` stream, while earlier versions use `stdout`. Both streams are now parsed for compatibility with all versions.

# v1.2.0
2021-01-10

- Added support for linting with [Verible](https://google.github.io/verible)
- Added functionality to parse verilator messages with locations in inactive files (files other than the one passed to the linter)
- Changed linter ID in lint messages from "Verilog/SystemVerilog" to "VerilogHDL" for consistency

# v1.1.1
2020-08-13

- Fixed an issue with the encoding of slang's output, making it OS-dependent; slang's Windows binary produces UTF-16 encoded output, while its Linux binary outputs UTF-8
- Added a default compiler option of "none" as well as a warning notification asking for a compiler to be chosen if this default option is set
- Added error checking for failure to invoke slang

# v1.1.0
2020-08-09

Added support for linting with [slang](https://sv-lang.com/).

# v1.0.0
2020-07-23

First release! The following changes were made to the source material from [linter-verilog](https://github.com/manucorporat/linter-verilog) and [linter-verilator](https://github.com/patstew/linter-verilator):

- Functionality from both source packages combined into one, for support of Icarus Verilog AND Verilator
- Dependencies brought up to date:
    - Code from linter-verilog updated for the [linter v2 API](https://github.com/steelbrain/linter/blob/v2.3.0/docs/guides/upgrading-to-standard-linter-v2.md)
    - [atom-linter](https://github.com/steelbrain/atom-linter) bumped to v10.0.0
    - [atom-package-deps](https://github.com/steelbrain/package-deps/blob/master/package.json) bumped to v6.0.0
- The parent directory of the file being linted is now added as an include path to iverilog, with proper support for errors in files besides the one being edited. This comes in part from [feilongfl's fork](https://github.com/feilongfl/linter-verilog) of linter-verilog
- Improved message positioning, particularly with verilator (which somtimes provides a column number that previously went unused)
- Added "source.systemverilog" grammar scope for compatibility with [language-systemverilog](https://atom.io/packages/language-systemverilog)
- Added a settings option for path to iverilog, like the setting for verilator's path in linter-verilator
- Added functionality for dealing with iverilog "sorry"-type messages:
    - These are now presented with "info" severity
    - Added an option to suppress "sorry" messages, since these aren't really helpful for linting
- Improved documentation, particularly for installing Verilator/Icarus Verilog
- Clarified the arguments that are added to ```iverilog``` or ```verilator``` commands to put either compiler in a mode for linting
